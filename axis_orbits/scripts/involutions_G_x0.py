r"""Show: All involutions in G_{x0} are in class 2A or 2B in the Monster

Here G_{x0} is the maximal subgroup of structure 2^{1+24}.Co_1 of the
Monster. We will show this fact with a brute-force computation uning the
python *mmgroup* package. For the proof we use standard facts about the
Leech lattice (mod 2) and its automorphism group Co_1, and the character
table of Co_1 in the ATLAS [CCN+85], but not any character table
of the Monster or of the group G_{x0}.

An involution in the group G_{x0} of structure 2^{1+24}.Co_1 of the
Monster is either in the subgroup Q_{x0} of structure 2^{1+24} of
G_{x0}, or it maps to one of the classes 2A, 2B, or 2C of involutions
in Co_1. Here classes in Co_1 are denoted as in the ATLAS [CCN+85].

The classes of involutions of G_{x0} contained in Q_{x0} are well
known. They can be described via the the canonical homomorphism from
Q_x0 to the Leech lattice mod 2 given in [Con85], ยง7. There a vector
in the Leech lattice mod 2 has a type. From Theorem 2 in [Con85] we
conclude that an involution in  $\Qx0$ must map to a vector of type
0, 2, or 4 in the Leech lattice mod 2. G_{x0} is transitive on
elements  of G_{x0} that map to vectors of type 2 or 4, respectivly;
and the unique preimage of a type-0 vector that is an involution in
Q_{x0} is the central involution in  Q_{x0}. The triality element
(obtained as ``MM('t', 1)`` in *mmgroup*) conjugates the central
involution in Q_{x0} to a element of  Q_{x0} corresponding to
a vector of type 4. 

Thus the involutions in Q_{x0} fuse to at most two classes in
the Monster; and a character calculation with *mmgroup* in the
198884-dimensional representation of the Monster shows that these
two classes are different. These two classes of involutions in the
Monster are called 2A and 2B in [CCN+85].

So it suffices to deal with the involutions in G_{x0} that map to
one of the classes 2A, 2B, or 2C in Co_1. It shows that all such 
involutions are in class 2A or 2B of the Monster.

We propose elements I2A, I2B, I2C of G_{x0} that map to the classes
2A, 2B, 2C in Co_1. We check that the squares of these elements are
in Qx0; and we use character calculations in the *mmgroup* package to
show that these elements map to involutions of the appropiate class
in Co_1. Note that the character of degree 299 of Co_1 in the ATLAS
is sufficient to distinguish between elements of Co_1 of classes
1A, 2A, 2B, and 2C. This character is available in *mmgroup*.

Then we use brute force to show that all involutions in the coset
I * Q_{x0}, with I = I2A, I2B, I2C, are in class 2A or 2B in the
Monster. Therefore we use method ``conjugate_involution`` in class
``MM``. This method conjugates any involution in the Monster into
the standard 2A or 2B involution of the Monster with a very high
probability and raises an exception in case of failure. Since this
script should provide a proof, we use this conjugation method as
an oracle, and we recalculate the corresponding conjugation
operations in this script.
